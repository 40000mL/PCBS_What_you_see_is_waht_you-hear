Here is the PCBS project replicating Experiment 1 in Sham et al.(2000) "What you see is what you hear".
Full study with details see Shams, L., Kamitani, Y., & Shimojo, S. (2002). Visual illusion induced by sound. Cognitive Brain Research, 14(1), 147â€“152. https://doi.org/10.1016/s0926-6410(02)00069-1

**Findings:**<br />
This expeirmient was famous for demonstrating a cross-modal perception interaction, namely visual and audio processing. In the results, the number of flashes perceived by participants were biased by the number of beeps, in single flash trials: when there was 1 flash displayed with x beeps, when asking how many flashes they saw, they reported not 1, but x) (fig 3). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47482896/117947255-501f2880-b310-11eb-824b-c15228224e47.png)

That was contrasting with the control trials: trials with only visual stimulus (0 beep) and trials with only 1 beep (fig 4).

**Design of Experiment 1:**<br />
There are 60 trials in total, with visual stimulus flashing from 1 to 4 times, and audio stimulus ranging from 0 to 4 times, with 3 trials* each condition. <br />
Illusion trials: 1 flash ~ x beeps (2<=x<=4);  <br />
Control trials: x flashes ~ x beeps (2<=x<=4), and x flashes~0 beep (2<=x<=4); <br />
<br />
The onsets of stimuli are summarized in the figure 2:
